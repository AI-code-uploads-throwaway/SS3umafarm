Uma "SpeedSpark+ Uma Farm Tool" (SS+ UFT for short). 

To use the script get the .hta file and run it to use the browser/window io to track skill gains. (Soon: to a certain turn No). 
 Shows skill points gained last turn (and a few turns before), current total skill points, and day number. 
 Shows bars on the screen for more ingame logistics tracking. 
To use the script place the .css styling in the same folder you have the .hta file in. 

If something isn't working then try download the .css file again, or add breakpoints/"on error continue next" and report the bug(s) if you find any! Or that would be appreciated.
