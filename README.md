Uma "SpeedSpark+ Uma Farm Tool" (SS+ UFT for short). This tracks skill points gained and days passed in career mode for the game: Umamusume, Pretty Derby. 

To use the script:
- Get the .hta file and run it to use the browser/window UI to track skill gains locally. (Soon: to a certain turn No.)
- Alternatively the tool can be run automatically (no download) from the command line with:
- - ``` mshta.exe https://webss3umafarm.github.io/tool.hta ```
- ** This may be outdated. Check https://github.com/webss3umafarm with the current version found in https://github.com/AI-code-uploads-throwaway/SS3umafarm/tree/main
- Optionally, the styles.css file can be downloaded (and tweaked). The default .css style will load from this github, however. The local styles.css file will always overwrite the github version (if you choose to update your local version). 
 
 Shows skill points gained last turn (and a few turns before), current total skill points, and day number. 
 Shows bars on the screen for more ingame logistics tracking. 
To use the script place the .css styling in the same folder you have the .hta file in. 

Soon(tm): Fixed progress bars; turn No. and base stats, inspirations, and utilization of Umamusume Pretty Derby API. 

If something isn't working then try download the .css file again, or add breakpoints/"on error continue next" and report the bug(s) if you find any! Or that would be appreciated.
